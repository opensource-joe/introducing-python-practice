# 6.1 Use a for loop to print the values of the list [3, 2, 1, 0].

# 6.2 Assign the value 7 to the variable guess_me, and the value 1 to the variable number. Write a while loop that compares number with guess_me. Print 'too low' if number is less than guess me. If number equals guess_me, print 'found it!' and then exit the loop. If number is greater than guess_me, print 'oops' and then exit the loop. Increment number at the end of the loop.

# 6.3 Assign the value 5 to the variable guess_me. Use a for loop to iterate a variable called number over range(10). If number is less than guess_me, print 'too low'. If it equals guess_me, print found it! and then break out of the for loop. If number is greater than guess_me, print 'oops' and then exit the loop.
